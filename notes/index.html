                <h2 class="E1">Why explanatory knowledge Creation is the greatest skill </h2>
                <h4> Reason:</h4>
                <p>All humans operate through explanatory knowledge — the internal models that shape perception, decision, and action. Most of this EK is implicit, formed through passive absorption from environment, biology, imitation, and cultural norms. It functions beneath awareness, yet defines how reality appears and how individuals behave. </p> <br>
                <p> However, the individual who actively constructs and refines explanatory knowledge — and further, builds meta-explanatory frameworks that guide how EK is formed, tested, and applied — gains a decisive advantage. This de-embedding of EK allows for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More accurate perception of reality.</li>
                    <li>Faster and more effective decision-making.</li>
                    <li>The creation of new, adaptive models.</li>
                    <li>Escape from the flawed, inherited EK of their environment.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p><b>The greatest skill is the creation of explanatory knowledge--</b>The more explanatory knowledge you build the more adequate you become into building new explanations with minimal assumptions. While others act within known constraints, the knowledge creator changes the constraints themselves.<p><br>
                <p><b>Example:</b>If you wanna do something you first must have explanatory that thing exist at first place, when you have inadequate explanatory knowledge its like you are blind. Though a human can hvae more EK than last time, never complete.</p>

                <h2 class="E2">Good Explanation and Bad Explanations</h2> <!-- Text alignted in right-->
                <h4 class="E2">The Reach:</h4>
                <p>Good Explanations are the onces grounded in reality more than assumptions, signs of a good explanation includes its unviversablity on how less it varies in different situations (as if a theory work somewhere and contradicts elsewhere it means it had some flaws as reality never contradicts.) and its reach on how far things can explianed through it</p>
                <p>Bad explanations on other hand are ones that very easy to vary, they are heavily based on assumptions and thier reach is very limited. Examples of this inlcude, student: <i>"People are moving from x country to y, why is that?"</i>teacher: <i>"because x country is corrupt & is focused on providing opportunities only to known."</i> This is a bad explanaton as it varies alot, and is heavily based on assumptions & leaves no space for critcism</p>
                <h3 class="E2">How to Create Good Explanations</h3>
                <p>Creating explanation is creative process of conjecturing with the help of your explanatory knowledge, your explanatory consists assumptions and lacks meta models to help you identify them, So build a meta explanatory model that helps identify your assumptions and challenge them to find the truth & when I said <i>"try to create explanations based on minimal"</i> keeping note in your mind is a also meta model.</p>
                <h3 class="E2"> A Meta Model on Avoiding assumptions after idenitfied</h3>
                <p>What is there, what it does, why and how.</p>
                <h3 class="E2">A Model on what something truly is</h3>
                <p>What it is(assumptions), what it is made of(material), what is its structure, what is its purpose. What it is (Final cause) </p>
                <h3 class="E2">Inversion: model for fast assupmtion fix</h3>
                <p>If it is not true, what else must true or if its true what else must be false for it to be true. (this requires high level of explanatory knowledge)</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="E3">Destination, Direction & ER, HTD</h2>
                <p>The concept of Destination, Direction & ER, HTD is Having Explanatory knowledge to define your goals(Expectations) and Create good explainations to achieve them & The problems you face while following the explainations are the ones you have to solve with good explanation. Destination, Directions are used to acheive a goal, ER and HTD to achieve a exepcted quality from of the tasks. To use this, you have habits that builds you Explanatory & meta explanatory knowledge and habits that makes you Convert things into soluable problems, them using core of destination, Direction & ER, HTD. Trying to achieve a goal is a form of a solving problem, but it is still important to treat goals differently in DD and problems differently, as a problem requires theory to follow, and a goal requires a theory to act towards.</p>
