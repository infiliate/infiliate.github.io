        <h3 id="heading-1">Core Philosophy</h3>
        <p>I like to code; it feels like a job I should have been doing, but coding is not the only thing I do. I like to read books reflectively, and I'm very influenced by the beginning of Infinity's insights on epistemology. I take notes from it and save it in <a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a>. My core philosophy is all about creating knowledge that is based on minimal assumptions and is consistently tested and refined. Though I could not create any great model to create knowledge, I have only taken notes. As I believe, if knowledge leads to no change in behaviour, then it is useless for that while.</p>
        <p><br><b>To explain my core philosophy in one sentence: </b>"Create knowledge that is based on minimal assumptions and is consistently tested and refined. Such knowledge leads to a change in behaviour and ultimately helps you create better explanations for problems. Before creating explanations, you need to cultivate the skill of asking questions related to what, why, and how. Always remember, if there is a destination, there must be a direction—it's just that you may lack the knowledge to find it. In short, key skills are <i>knowledge creation, defining destination, and creating directions</i>."</p>

    <div class="objectives">
        <h3 id="heading-2">Objectives: What'll Be Written and Why</h3>
        <p>The primary objective is to document my key learnings—not just about coding, but about learning through coding and other activities.</p>
        <h4>Here is an organized list of what'll be noted here:</h4>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Projects I created through this journey of code</li>
            <li>Snapshots of this personal blog</li>
            <li>Notes on learning</li>
            <li>Notes on knowledge creation (Private)</li>
            <li>Journal of learning</li>
            <li>Important personal info</li>
            <li>Other topics that may be added in the future</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="Design">
        <h3 id="heading-3">Design: How Will This Site Evolve</h3>
        <p>I will apply most of my learnings in building this site, so how good this site will be is related to how much I have learned.</p>
        <h4>But here are my core design principles:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple</li>
            <li>Minimal</li>
            <li>User friendly</li>
            <li>Attentive to detail</li>
            <li>Focused</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In a sentence: design that people can feel.</p>
